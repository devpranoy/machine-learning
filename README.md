This is a repo for ml workshop from college

Notes:


-----------------------Day 1-------------------

Teaching the computer without explicit code.
make the machine understand.

Applications
weather prediction
stock market prediction
You-tube video suggestion

Types
supervised
     -provide past data
     -generate patterns
     -structure data(dog/cat analogy hair,size,etc) 
un-supervised
    -unstructured data

ONLY 5 different types of algorithms
    1.classification
    2.regression
    3.anomaly detection
    4.clustering
    5.reinforcement

Classification(knn,decision tree classifier etc)
    knn - k nearest neighbor algorithm
    has discrete  values

Regression 
     has continuous values

Clustering
     group the data

Anomaly detection 
     eg Spam changes in data

Reinforcement learning
      punishment/reward 


Practical implementation
step 1 -get data
step2 -clean data
step3 -make a model
step4-train
step5 -Predict

DEPENDENCIES PYTHON3
https://github.com/scriptonist/scripts

Apple/orange
Gender classification
packages
scikitlearn -ml library, graph and stuff



================================== DAY 2===========================

references sirajology and udacity

knn algorithm implementation
challenge: take 5 algorithm test with iris and find out the one with the most accuracy

>70 accuracy is good

world challenge:
create a face detection algorithm

Linear Regression

Random forest
Give massive data, creates different decision tree and executes everything together

SDG classifier Schotiomatic gradient decent will optimise the the model to provide better accuracy and helps  in generalisation
Refer Jupyter Notebooks from the gut repo of Udacity pytorch
